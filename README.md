# Electricity Demand Prediction
**Minjie Lu**

## 1. Objective
The prediction can be used by the electricity authorities to make better resource schedule, for example, to decide whether to turn on a large plant. Better schedule can avoid the waste caused by long range transmission, more importantly, avoid large scale power outage when the demand becomes much higher than the supply.

## 2. Data
The hourly electricity operation data are obtained through the API provided by the Energy Information Administration website.
